# Data-Cleaning-SQL

## This project focuses on cleaning and organizing a dataset related to global layoffs. The key tasks involved in this project include:

* Removing Duplicates: Using a common table expression (CTE) and ROW_NUMBER() to identify and remove duplicate records based on multiple columns (e.g., company, location, industry).
* Standardizing Data: Creating staging tables to manage data consistency and ensure fields like company, location, and funds_raised_millions follow a standard format.
* Handling Null/Blank Values: Identifying and managing missing values to ensure the dataset is complete and reliable.
* Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Removing columns that are not required for analysis to streamline the dataset.

##This process ensures that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis.
